# Insoft GFX Pixel Sprite Atlas Creator

#### piXatlas
- Creates an Insoft GFX Pixel Sprite Atlas file from a given set of BMP file/s.

This is a handy command line tool for creating Insoft GFX sprites from a collection of .bmp (Bitmap) image files.
The Insoft GFX sprite atlas shares a familiar structure with the Adafruit GFX Pixel Font and can serve as a substitute when color/anti-alias glyphs are needed.
